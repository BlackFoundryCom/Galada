Galada is the Bengali companion to the Lobster typeface. It is a Display typeface that works well at larger sizes.

While remaining traditional in terms of letterform style, for optimal legibility, it shares common characteristics with Lobster: slanted, compact, and heavy, and the cursivity is achieved by the use of inflexions on the horizontal connecting stroke reminding what is happening on Lobster Latin baseline. It conveys the informality and sturdiness of the original Lobster font translated into the Bengali script.
